# broadcast-channel-test
A page demonstrating communication between same-origin windows via the BroadcastChannel API and that looks like an IM app even though messages can only be seen on the user's computer. Set a nickname, create/join multiple channels, leave channels and send messages. Open multiple browser windows on this page, create a common channel (all is the default) and see the magic!
